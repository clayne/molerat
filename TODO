timers

Check mutex ownership on tasklet exit?

tasklet_now -> tasklet_goto

thread API probably better pointer-based

new socket read/write interfaces (return code indicates blocked,
progress (>0), error, closed)

thorough testing of http reader (byte-by-byte parsing, large bodies,
prebody-body-prebody handling)

Fix the spurious accept issue in socket.c

ERROR_INVALID to replace many asserts
