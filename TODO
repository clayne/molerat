Special readstream and writestream things.  Sockets have these.
Stream utils for a stream on a file, comparing streams, etc.  Use
these for http-reader and writer tests.

Propagate syscall errors from poll_epoll

optimize growbuf_reserve

writer should have special content-length support, and know when to
emit content-close (uhmmm, always).  For HTTP/1.0 reqs, always need a
content-length when writing a body.  For HTTP/1.1 reqs, can do chunked
with no-content-length.

comments on http_writer

writev response

speak http/1.0 (i.e. to support ab)

allow thread debuggging bits to be compiled out

can use timerfds for timers

show tasklet handler in run_queue_run asserts

make http server serve files

SSL support

URL parsing

Check mutex ownership on tasklet exit?
Refine thread.c lock held checking (use thread id)

thread API probably better pointer-based

thorough testing of http reader (byte-by-byte parsing, large bodies,
prebody-body-prebody handling)

ERROR_INVALID to replace many asserts

tasklet: current_stopped and current_requeue should be combined into a
single state flag.

Make test programs timeout
